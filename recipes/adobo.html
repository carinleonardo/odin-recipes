    <h1>Adobo Fried Rice</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Adobo is a staple in our home. My mom always cooks a large batch
        because it stores well and, arguably, tastes better the longer it sits
        in the fridge.</p>
    <p>It's easy to get tired of eating the same thing every day.
        One of the best ways to spruce up leftover adobo is by turning it into
        Adobo Fried Rice.</p>
    <p>For this recipe, I reference <a href="https://www.manilaspoon.com/2018/02/adobo-fried-rice.html">Manila
            Spoon</a>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp neutral Oil, <em>vegetable, canola, avocado</em></i></li>
        <li>5 cloves Garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>Leftover, cooked rice</li>
        <li>Left-over Pork Adobo, <em>shredded</em></li>
        <li>Salt, <em>to taste</em></li>
        <li>Green onions</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, <em>for color</em></li>
        <li>Fried egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Head the oil in a woke or large frying pan on meadium heat.

            include any leftover sauce. </li>
        <li>Add the prepared rice into the garlic and rice mixture. Stir-fry
            until rice is heated. Season with salt to taste and add soy sauce
            deepen the fried rice's color.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sliced green onions and top with a fried egg.</li>
    </ol>
