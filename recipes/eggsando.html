    <h1>Egg Sando</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my go to meals is an egg (<em>tagmago</em>) sando. I love the combination of
        soft, fluffy bread with a simple, savory spread. What makes an egg sando unique
        is it's use of <em>Shokupan</em> or "milk bread", a sweet and pillowy, Japanese
        bread.</p>
    <p>For this recipe, I used <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/japanese-egg-sandwich-tamago-sando/">Just One
            Cookbook's Japanese Egg Sandwich</a> recipe</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices shokupan</li>
        <li>salted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Japanese mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparing the Egg Salad</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the eggs in a medium saucepan filled with water.
            Bring it to a boil and cook for 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once finished, transfer the eggs into a bowl of iced water
            to stop the cooking process. Peel the eggshells.</li>
        <li>Transfer the peeled eggs into a bowl and mash with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, salt, milk, and mayonnaise.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembling the Egg Sando</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out two slices of bread. Butter one side of each slice of bread.
            Generously spread the egg salad on on slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Cut the crust off the bread.</li>
        <li>Cut the sandwich in half and serve.</li>
    </ol>
